            My usual poker friends play for fun - a bit of money changes hands but thats not the point.
            Ostensibly our payout system was done for the sake of someone on a fixed income, but
            is mainly an excuse to limit any one person't losses to a managable level where they will
            keep coming back, month after month.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mechanism we use to limit losses is twofold:
            <ol>
        <li>
            provide $42.50 worth of chips for a
            $25 cash buy-in (yes, it is a nominal exchange rate of 17-to-10 )

        </li>
        <li>
            If anyone squanders their chips we just give them - and everyone else - more money
            This pushes the excange rate to 5-to-2, but we don't care much.
        </li>
        </ol>
            At the end of the night, if we can remember how much extra "stimulus" chips we added to the game
            we subract them out. Then we count up whatever we have and divide it into the total cash we have
            to get the real final excange rate and payouts.
        </p>

            It was complex enough that <a href="http://johnb.github.io/poker.html">I wrote an app for it</a>. But I wasnever completely satisfied
            with that version, so here is v2.0.
